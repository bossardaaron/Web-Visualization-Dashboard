## Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations to plot [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

Created individual pages for each plot and a means by which they can be navigated. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations in addition to a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
